# Songure

  

> This doc helps you for a brainless configuration of the stack inside the docker-compose file. Following this doc step-by-step, you won't have any issue.

  

## 1

### Create a .env file

Inside the root folder of your project, create a .env file with these data in it

  

> DB_ROOT=<db_user>

> DB_PASS=<db_pass>

  

Remember that you have to replace <db_user> and <db_pass> with the credentials that you will use for the next steps about DB configuration

  

## 2

### Create config file for the communication between DB container and Backend Apis

  

open up a terminal inside the root folder of <b>songure</b> and type these commands

  
```
$ cd songure-api/app/config/

...

$ mv config.local.py config.py

...
```
  

Now, open it with this command:

`$ nano config.py`

  

You have to replace the fields with your own data.

Below the description about the fields.

  
```
config = {

	"dev": { # the environment. At the moment only dev leave it as is

		"db_host": "127.0.0.1", # the db host where its located. You can leave it as is if you decided to use everything in only one server

		"db_port": "27017", # the db port. Remember to replace it even in the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml

		"db_name": "songure", # Your db name, you can replace as you want

		"db_admin": "admin", # db username. Replace it with the same username put inside the .env at the step 1

		"db_password": "password", # same as db username

		"google_client_id": "xxxxxx", # your google client id

		"google_secret_id":"xxxxxx" # your google secret key
	}

}
```

  ### Configure endpoints for Google login
Set the following route inside the "redirect url" section onto the api console on google

> http://localhost:8080/api/Oauth2Callback


## 4

### Deploy your stack! :rocket:

Now you're ready for the deployment! move into the <b>songure root folder</b> and launch this command

`$ docker-compose up -d --build`

> If you want to delete everything, instead launch the following commands

```
$ docker-compose down

	Stopping songure-api ... done

	Stopping mongo-db ... done

	Removing songure-api ... done

	Removing mongo-db ... done

	Removing network songure_default

$ docker volume prune

	WARNING! This will remove all local volumes not used by at least one container.

	Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y

	Deleted Volumes:

	9a0f69bd90cf6bb6aafe88239b50ba144f6f972a30f8e04fb6f33f42aafef0f4

	aee3bf9d42f7d611ea606a15f4e4447680b378900a7da914e922770163e26877

	songure_db-backup

	songure_db

	Total reclaimed space: 315.2MB

$ docker image prune

	WARNING! This will remove all dangling images.

	Are you sure you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

If you want to be sure that everything is clear, launch the following commands and check the response; if it says that there are containers/volums/network about the songure stack, feel free to remove them!

```
$ docker container ls

	CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED STATUS PORTS NAMES

$ docker volume ls

	DRIVER VOLUME NAME

$ docker image ls

	REPOSITORY TAG IMAGE ID CREATED SIZE
```
